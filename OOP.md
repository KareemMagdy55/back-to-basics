\# Programming Paradigms: An Overview



Before diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it's essential to grasp the broader category under which OOP falls. This category is called \*\*Programming Paradigms\*\*.



The term \*\*paradigm\*\* refers to the approach and style you adopt when writing and organizing your code. The two main programming paradigms are:



\* \*\*Imperative Programming\*\*

\* \*\*Declarative Programming\*\*



\## 1. Imperative Programming Paradigm



In the imperative paradigm, you explicitly define the sequence of operations, focusing on how each task is accomplished(e.g. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Procedural Programming, and Structured Programming).



\### Example (C#):



```csharp

// Initialize the sum variable

int sum = 0;

var arr = \[3, 1, 9, 5];



// Calculate the sum by iterating through the array

for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++) {

&nbsp;   sum += arr\[i];

}



// Output the result

Console.WriteLine(sum);

```



\## 2. Declarative Programming Paradigm



In the declarative paradigm, you focus on describing the desired outcome rather than detailing the steps to achieve it. The "how" is handled by the system. (e.g. Database Processing Approach, Logic Programming, and Functional Programming).



\### Example (C#):



```csharp

var arr = \[3, 1, 9, 5];

int sum = arr.Aggregate((i, j) => i + j); // Perform aggregation and obtain the result



Console.WriteLine(sum);

```



\### Example (SQL):



```sql

-- The query specifies: "Return numbers greater than five" without needing to define how it's done

SELECT num FROM numbers WHERE num > 5;

```
